# Direct Listing Strike Prompts — 2026-09-10

**Purpose:** convert today's strongest verified paid Three.js/WebGL listings into bounded Kimi execution prompts.

**Rule:** build proof for the capability the buyer requests; do not recreate unpaid client deliverables, scrape client assets, or contact/apply automatically. Human reviews every proposal.

## Strike order

1. $3,000 real-time product animation / web-ready GLB assets — highest fit and strongest client history.
2. $30–$300/hr Three.js technical-artist consultant — fastest path because existing fabric/material systems already cover much of the proof.
3. $2,000–$5,000 knitwear configurator — viable only after a clean generic configurator proof exists; competition is high.
4. $10,000 procedural industrial homepage loop — high-value fourth strike; heavier proof, so do not let it block the first three.

# STRIKE 1 — $3,000 Web-Ready Product Animation / GLB

Listing: https://www.upwork.com/freelance-jobs/apply/Real-time-product-animation-for-the-web-game-ready-GLB-assets-for-Three-scroll-experience_~022097076063773171612/

## Kimi prompt

Read:
- `tools/fromage-webgl-kit/KIMI_PROTOTYPE_BATCH_2026-09-10.md`
- `tools/fromage-webgl-kit/prototypes/product-motion-lab/`
- `tools/fromage-webgl-kit/src/`

Execute **only the Product Motion Lab proof** for the currently live $3,000 real-time product-animation listing.

The buyer needs web-ready 3D assets for a Three.js / React Three Fiber scroll experience. Their actual production scope is two supplied handheld diagnostic products, with game-ready topology, PBR metal/rough materials, web-compressed GLBs, named scrub-safe animation clips, parented anchor locators, transparent beauty stills, and editable DCC source. We do **not** have their product geometry, so do not imitate or infer their proprietary product.

Build a clean-room generic proof that demonstrates the same production thinking using original procedural or owned geometry.

### Required proof

1. Use a neutral original handheld-device-like object with at least one animated subassembly.
2. Keep the scene presentation clinical, precise, restrained and neutral — not a fantasy/Melodia treatment.
3. Structure the object as if it were destined for glTF/GLB delivery:
   - clean parent/child hierarchy;
   - meaningful node names;
   - named locator/anchor objects;
   - compact material set;
   - no environment lighting baked into textures.
4. Implement deterministic scrub-safe phases named conceptually like:
   - `rotate_in`;
   - `use_sequence`;
   - `idle`.
   The same normalized time must always produce the same pose.
5. Ensure at least three callout anchors remain correctly parented to moving parts while scrubbing.
6. Add a concise budget panel showing:
   - triangles;
   - draw calls;
   - DPR;
   - approximate FPS;
   - texture count / approximate texture dimensions if relevant;
   - current asset byte size if a GLB exists.
7. Add one QA inspection mode such as wireframe/normals/material isolation.
8. Verify slider scrub `0 → 1 → 0` and scroll scrub both drive the same deterministic timeline.
9. Verify desktop and phone-width behavior.
10. If practical, create/export one original GLB demonstrating the hierarchy and named nodes. If Kimi cannot reliably produce the DCC/glTF file, keep the browser primitive group and document the exact Blender export structure we would use; do not fabricate a successful GLB export.

### Buyer-specific evidence note

Create `LISTING_3000_EVIDENCE.md` containing:
- what was actually executed;
- measured scene stats;
- how the demo maps to the buyer's requested 30–80k-triangle / 2K-max / compressed-web-asset mindset;
- how named clips and parented locators would map into a client-supplied Blender asset;
- which requested production requirements are **not yet proven** (e.g. KTX2/Basis or Draco/meshopt if we have not actually tested them);
- two or three existing live portfolio/demo URLs we can truthfully show if available;
- one suggested concise answer for “typical triangle + texture budget for a hero web asset.”

### Hard stop

Do not model a diagnostic product from the listing, do not create twelve requested beauty renders for an imaginary product, do not write React integration, and do not submit a proposal.

Finish when the generic proof is runtime-clean and proposal-ready.

# STRIKE 2 — $30–$300/hr Three.js Fabric Technical Artist Consultant

Listing: https://www.upwork.com/freelance-jobs/apply/Three-Technical-Artist-Consultant_~022092763085840401535/

## Kimi prompt

This is a **consulting-proof extraction task**, not a new shader-lab build.

First inspect the existing fabric/material systems in `fromage3900/my-site`, especially:
- `wix/realtime-3d-viewer.html`;
- `wix/melodia-3d-viewport.js`;
- `wix/melodia-atelier-lab.html` / `.js`;
- `wix/sdf-material-gallery.html`;
- any clearly owned supporting fabric PBR textures and material documentation.

The buyer wants strategic guidance on realistic fabric/garment visuals in Three.js: 3D asset preparation, PBR materials, lighting/rendering, texture maps, and an automated path from fabric swatches to production-ready normal/roughness/displacement/etc. They explicitly describe this as consulting/strategy rather than production.

### Goal

Turn our **existing** fabric/material work into an honest consultant-facing evidence package. Do not rebuild the existing lab unless a missing capability materially improves the proof.

### Required work

1. Runtime-check the existing fabric viewer / material atlas locally.
2. Inventory what it already demonstrates:
   - fabric preset switching;
   - PBR map usage;
   - roughness/specular/sheen behavior;
   - lighting response;
   - texture organization;
   - inspection/turntable behavior.
3. Separate assets into:
   - clearly owner-authored/reusable;
   - third-party/uncertain provenance;
   - Melodia-specific/noncommercial.
   Do not expose uncertain assets as commercial samples.
4. Identify the **smallest missing generic proof** needed for this listing. Prefer one addition, not a new application. Examples:
   - grazing-angle inspection lighting;
   - close-up textile inspection camera;
   - editable roughness/normal/sheen multipliers;
   - concise material-state readout.
5. If one such addition is justified, implement it in a clean-room commercial demo under `tools/fromage-webgl-kit/prototypes/` without modifying the deployed portfolio.
6. Write `FABRIC_CONSULTANT_EVIDENCE.md` covering:
   - current capabilities we can demonstrate;
   - a recommended Three.js fabric lookdev stack;
   - swatch capture → tileable base/albedo → normal → roughness → optional height/displacement → color management → validation workflow;
   - what should be measured from physical fabric versus artist-authored;
   - where Three.js approximations differ from measured BRDF/fiber rendering;
   - an automation architecture for batch-producing candidate texture resources without claiming the full pipeline already exists.
7. Produce one compact consultant-facing diagram/checklist in Markdown for evaluating third-party 3D artists/material work.
8. Finish with a list of **3 concrete questions we would ask the client before advising their pipeline**.

### Hard stop

Do not claim measured fabric BRDFs, CLO expertise, automated photometric swatch capture, or physically exact reproduction unless repository evidence actually proves it. Do not rebuild the Fabric Material Lab from scratch. Do not contact the client.

# STRIKE 3 — $2,000–$5,000 Knitwear Three.js Configurator

Listing: https://www.upwork.com/freelance-jobs/apply/Three-Product-Configurator-Developer-Week-Fixed-Price_~022093492314330845907/

## Kimi prompt

The buyer wants a one-garment sweater configurator delivered as an embeddable component: orbit/zoom, stitch texture switching, color switching, chest embroidery/decal, and export of the final configuration as JSON. They supply the GLB. Their listing explicitly says applicants without a live configurator example will not be considered.

Our objective today is **not to clone Knitup or perform their job for free**. Build the minimum clean-room configurator proof that establishes we can execute the interaction model.

### Starting point

Reuse:
- the Fromage WebGL Kit runtime and GLB-loader primitives;
- safe generic material/fabric logic already in our repo where provenance permits;
- a completely original procedural garment-like/swatch-like object or an owned/CC0 generic garment asset.

Do not use client assets or copy Knitup branding/UI.

### Required proof

Create or finish a generic `product-configurator` prototype under `tools/fromage-webgl-kit/prototypes/` with:

1. orbit + zoom;
2. one product/garment surface with at least three independently authored surface/stitch presets;
3. live base-color selection;
4. one generic chest decal/patch selector using locally generated/original marks;
5. a state model like:
   ```json
   {
     "surface": "...",
     "color": "...",
     "decal": "..."
   }
   ```
6. visible JSON export/copy or downloadable local JSON — no backend;
7. reset-to-default state;
8. mobile-width layout;
9. diagnostics for FPS/DPR/draw calls/triangles;
10. architecture notes showing where a client-supplied GLB and a host site's save/order integration would plug in.

### Evidence

Create `LISTING_KNITWEAR_CONFIGURATOR_EVIDENCE.md` containing:
- runtime-tested features;
- desktop + phone-width evidence paths;
- sample exported JSON;
- what would be required to convert the proof into an embeddable production component;
- what is intentionally absent: ecommerce/order backend, arbitrary uploads, React wrapper if not implemented, and client-specific GLB integration.

### Hard stop

Do not copy the referenced website, do not implement ecommerce/cart/order processing, do not fabricate a React/R3F implementation if the proof is vanilla Three.js, and do not submit the application.

Finish when we have a genuinely live configurator URL/local demo we can truthfully link in an application.

# STRIKE 4 — $10,000 Procedural Industrial Homepage Loop (after 1–3)

Listing: https://www.upwork.com/freelance-jobs/apply/artist-animate-and-build-the-the-loop-animation-the-company-homepage_~022096976272432704858/

Do this only after the first three are evidence-complete.

Use the existing `procedural-industrial-loop` brief. Focus on an original mechanical scene with deterministic procedural motion and clearly labelled illustrative STRUCTURAL / FLOW / THERMAL visualization styles. Their actual job uses supplied CAD and a supplied prototype/spec; do not reconstruct their proprietary scene. Demonstrate constrained system-driven animation, surface control, and web-delivery awareness. Create `LISTING_10000_EVIDENCE.md`, then stop.

---

# End-of-day decision gate

After each strike, rescore its listing using `SERVICES.md`.

Only prepare an application when:
- runtime evidence exists;
- proof is honestly relevant;
- no requested must-have is being falsely claimed;
- the listing still appears open/current;
- the likely economics still justify applying.

Human approval is required before any submission.
