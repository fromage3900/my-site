# Three.js Revenue Lane — 2026-09-10

**Status:** ACTIVE SIDECAR EXPERIMENT  
**Parent strategy:** `tools/fromage-webgl-kit/strategy/PAID_PROBLEM_RADAR_BUILD_NOW_2026-09-10.md`  
**Owner priority remains:** `MelodiaMelusinaV2/CURRENT_STATE.md`

## Thesis

Three.js/WebGL is the first revenue experiment because the existing portfolio already demonstrates interactive 3D/browser work and because a reusable browser runtime can compound across client work, microgames, viewers, music experiences and procedural scenes.

The production kit is intentionally housed in the website repository rather than the UE game repository:

`fromage3900/my-site/tools/fromage-webgl-kit/`

Current kit inventory:

- reusable Three.js runtime/lifecycle;
- GLB loading wrapper;
- tiny deterministic game-state helper;
- Web Audio FFT/reactive bus;
- clean-room playable microgame template;
- five bounded service SKUs;
- first-$20 revenue proof gate.

## Initial commercial services

1. Three.js / WebGL Rescue Pass
2. Interactive 3D Product / Asset Viewer
3. Branded Browser Microgame
4. Interactive Music World / Visualizer
5. Procedural WebGL Environment Prototype

## Rule of reuse

Every accepted paid WebGL job should leave behind at least one generic, owned, reusable improvement to the kit after project/client IP is removed.

The desired compounding loop is:

```text
paid problem
→ closest existing template
→ small client-specific delta
→ delivery + evidence
→ clean-room generic extraction
→ next similar job becomes cheaper
```

## Immediate gate

Do **not** build all five service demos.

Prepare only:

1. one rescue/optimization proof;
2. one generic viewer proof;
3. the existing clean-room microgame proof;
4. ten scored prospects → keep top three;
5. human-reviewed outreach;
6. first payment with at least CAD $20 allocated to `EARNED_POOL`.

After that gate, review actual demand before adding more abstractions or products.

## Capstone boundary

This work may consume outputs that naturally emerge from capstone/site work, but must not displace Choral Sheep P0 or reopen the public website redesign. The WebGL kit lives under `tools/` specifically so commercial infrastructure can evolve without changing the recruiter-facing deployment surface.
